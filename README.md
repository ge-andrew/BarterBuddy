Our vision for BarterBuddy is to provide a low-stakes, safe, fun environment for people to trade their excess goods and lower cost items locally. The application would be a fun way for users to exercise their inner businessman or businesswoman, while also being waste-reductive. 

Technologies used:
- Firebase Database, Image Storage, and Authentication
- Android Studio (Java) with RecyclerViews, Adapters, Dialog Boxes, Toasts, etc.
- Scrum Sprints, Daily Standups, and Retrospectives
- Software Development Cycle

Features:
- Login and Logout
- View a Public Market of nearby items
- Initiate offers on public items
- Add your own items to sell
- Set an item to active for others to see
- View and negotiate on sent offers
- Approve and deny incoming offers in a Tinder style game
- Haggle the price of any trade, up to six counteroffers
- Chat with the other party to finalize logistics
- Rate other users after trade concludes
